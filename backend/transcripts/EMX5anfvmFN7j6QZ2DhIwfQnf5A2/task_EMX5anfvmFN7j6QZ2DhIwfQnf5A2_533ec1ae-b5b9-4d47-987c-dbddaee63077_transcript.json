So I will try that again with another. Why? Isn't it not go to? Yes. This is my second file, so we need to send this again. What? Why? Yeah. I'll so one more file. I will try with the three files, so it need to process properly in three files. If it's processing, then I can consider this as, say, finish the job, then I will implement few more features like what it is. Like, for separate user, we need to create separate separate card system. That's what I am thinking. Also, what happened the pre What it need to do is it need to process this audio through the Deepgram, and that's what I am expecting is it processing. So it need to properly process and handle the multiple loading multiple load ins also. So that is my main intention. So I'm not sure is it happening proper or not. So I will check if the audio is creating, and I'm waiting for to generate some audio samples. So, generally, I can test this feature right now. This one, the voice recognition is not working properly, I think, because of my recording quality. So now I will try again with the new samples.",
